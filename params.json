The 6 Kids love to play video games.\r\n\r\n## Our Work\r\n\r\n### ZombAttack\r\n\r\n[[ZombAttack Logo]](https://github.com/6KidsGames/ZombAttack/blob/master/Sprites/ZombAttackLogo1.png \"ZombAttack\")\r\n\r\nZombAttack is a fun, zombie apocalyptic game, featuring eight different weapons, including a chainsaw and a minigun. ZombAttack also features two different maps, the City and the Farm. ZombAttack encourages players to work together to defeat the zombies that attack you, but also prevents internet trolls, as the players can't hurt each other. There are four different types of zombies: Crawlers (the slowest), Shamblers (the second slowest), Walkers, and Runners (the fastest). A full list of the weapons is, in order from worst to best: the Dagger (you spawn with the Dagger), the Halligan Tool, the Sword, the Chainsaw, the Pistol, the Rifle, the Machine Gun, and the Minigun.",
